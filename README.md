# Empty Robot

Sample code used to create new repositories

## Reminders

- [ ] Fetch your current branch before start to work
- [ ] Create a branch to work on your changes
- [ ] Push your changes to the remote at the end of the day so you can access it from any machine
- [ ] Create a PR to merge back to main branch

## Contributions

The repositories are public, and you should be able to clone them without extra permissions.

If you want to push code directly, you need to ask for writing permissions.

- [ ] Get writing permissions (optional)
  - [ ] Join the Aztechs programming team 
    - [ ] Create a Github account
    - [ ] Go to the `#programming` channel in the Aztechs Slack and ask permissions to the Github repositories
